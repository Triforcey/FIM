###(Firebase Instant Messaging)

This is a chat I've been working on using Firebase. It is  a huge improvement from the tutorial one. Still a work in progress! The website is fim.firebaseapp.com. If you wan't to download the code, Here's some info you might want.

 * index.html is the main file
 * 404.html is the error page

 You can ignore the firebase.json file. It doesn't have any part in it.
